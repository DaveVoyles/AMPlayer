# AMPlayer
AMPlayer is the [Azure Media Player](http://amsplayer.azurewebsites.net/), a free and open source video player for Azure Media Services playback.

I wrote a series of tutorials on how to use this media player, as well as an overview of HTML5 video player technology, and how to live stream video with Azure Media Services.

Here is a full list of the tutorials:
