# AMPlayer
AMPlayer is the [Azure Media Player](http://amsplayer.azurewebsites.net/), a free and open source video player for Azure Media Services playback.

I wrote a series of tutorials on how to use this media player, as well as an overview of HTML5 video player technology, and how to live stream video with Azure Media Services.
